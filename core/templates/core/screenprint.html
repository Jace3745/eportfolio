        <h1>Screenprinting Project</h1>
        <p>This is my second webpage for this course.</p>
	<h2>Thinking of ideas</h2>

        <p>In my new media and technology class, my teacher assigned me a screen printing project. First are teacher gave us some inspiration like examples of Uncle ben some other inspirational pictures for inspiration. A lot of inspirational ones spoke to me so I dedcided to make one to make people feel better. I dedcided to do a thumbs up and a message like It's ok it get better. </p>
	<h2>Taking pictures</h2>
	<p>The next step was starting to take photos to use in photoshop. With the help of my tablemates, they helped me take picture to use. I also made sure to help them take pictures.The picture went with had a blank backround with my right hand giving a thumbs up.</h2>

<h2>Photoshop</h2>
<p>Next I downloaded my photo and put it in to phototshop. There a made layers and edits to my picture.The most important thing to do was to make sure that I had only one or 2 colors. I only used one color which was like a light orange brown color.</p>

<h2>Illustrator</h2>
<p>After finishing in photoshop I moved it into illustrator to make mt cut list and my color mixing guide. This also allowed me to know what I have to do when I get to later steps.</p>

<h2>Cutting and Stretching</h2>
<p>Now it is time to cut my screen to stretch on my frame. I cut the screen according to my cut list.Cutting my screen took a couple trys but I got it perfect. Now I stapled and stretched my screen onto my frame with help from my teacher and my tablemates.Then I tapped over the staples.
<h2>Vinyl Cutting and Heat Pressing</h2>
<p>Now use my photoshop png file to start cutting my vinyl. I cut out a piece of vinyl according to my cut list. I uploaded my png to silhouette studio so I can upload to png to the vinyl cutting machine. After ti finished cutting I heat pressed the vinyl into my screen make sure to get the corners. To finish i tapped the inbetween the frame to make sure paint doesn't go through where I dont want it to.</p>
<h2>Mixing the Paint and pushing paint through screen</h2>
<p>Now I started to mix my paint to make my desired color. I used yellow red white and a drop of black to get my color to look like the one on my cut list. After I got my color it was now time push the paint throught the screen. After that was done had my final product and I loved it.</p>

<h2>21st century skills</h2>
<p>In reflection I demonstarted my skills generates, expresses, and evaluates new ideas from multiple perspectives. For example when I was picking what I was going to print on to my fabric. Instead of doing something simple also while not making it to cofident and trying not to be like anyone else. Showing my creavity and taking a question from a diffrent prespective.
