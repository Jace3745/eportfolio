<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Have you ever watched a water polo game? My name is Jace Lieto, I am in 9th grade and I live in East Haven, CT. One thing I like to do is play water polo. In the future, I want to play D1 water polo. For the last two summers, I went to the Junior Olympics in Texas. I also like math. Right now, I am in pre-calc, and my major in college is undecided.Lastly, I love my two dogs. I like to take them on walks, play fetch with them, and most of all, snuggle with them. I am kind, determined, and confident. These are things that make meâ€¦ me.
